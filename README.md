# ancli
Building argument parser from a function annotation. A simple utility inspired by 
`Fire` and `docopt`. Ad-hoc solution for someone who often writes scripts with a 
single entry point.

## How?

The process of building CLI with `ancli` is very simple.
1. Write a plain Python function with annotated parameters.
2. Wrap it with `make_cli`.
3. Run your script.


## Examples

### 1. Function with annotated parameters

```python
```
